# Module 3: Networking and Troubleshooting

## Subtopic: TCP/IP Fundamentals
The TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) is a suite of communication protocols used to connect network devices on the internet. TCP/IP can also be used as a communications protocol in a private network.

### Definition
TCP/IP is a two-layer program. The higher layer, Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), manages the assembling of a message or file into smaller packets that are transmitted over the internet and received by a TCP layer that reassembles the packets into the original message. The lower layer, Internet Protocol (IP), fulfills the task of addressing, routing, and delivering the final destination.

### History and Importance
The development of TCP/IP came from research conducted by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency in the early 1970s. After the advent of the World Wide Web and the Internet in the mid-1990s, TCP/IP became the standard for transmitting data over networks. Today, every device connected to the Internet, be it a personal computer, smartphone, or an IoT device, communicates through TCP/IP protocol.

### OSI Model and TCP/IP Model
TCP/IP communication is largely based on the framework called the OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) Model. This reference model has seven layers and each layer serves a specific purpose. Conversely, the TCP/IP Model has four layers: Network Interface, Internet, Transport, and Application. It’s crucial to note that the functionalities of the OSI layers aren't the same as the TCP/IP layers even though they might seem identical.

### TCP/IP Layers
Let’s examine the four layers of the TCP/IP model:

1. **Network Interface Layer**:  This is the lowest layer of the TCP/IP model. Its primary function is to allow the host to insert data into the network. Different protocols operate in this layer to fulfill various needs like addressing, framing, and sending/receiving data.

2. **Internet Layer**: This layer is responsible for sending packets from any network to any network. Major protocols in this layer are IP (Internet Protocol), ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol), ARP (Address Resolution Protocol), RARP (Reverse Address Resolution Protocol), and IGMP (Internet Group Management Protocol).

3. **Transport Layer**: This is responsible for transmitting data from source to destination on the Internet or another TCP/IP network. It includes the two most crucial protocols: TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol).

4. **Application Layer**: It provides applications with the ability to access the services of the other layers and defines the protocols that applications use to exchange data.

### IP Addressing
A key part of using TCP/IP is IP addressing. Every device on a TCP/IP network has a unique IP address that identifies the device. An IP address is a string of numbers divided into four sections. Each number can range from 0 to 255. The standard IP addressing mode, IPv4, allows for almost 4.3 billion unique addresses. With the growth of the internet, the newer version, IPv6, has been introduced to provide almost limitless unique addresses.

### TCP/IP Protocols
In TCP/IP networking, several protocols are used to govern how data is sent and received. The two central protocols, TCP and IP, are integrated with other protocols to make the entire suite of Internet Protocols. These include protocols like HTTP, FTP, SSH, DNS, SMTP, POP, IMAP, and many more.

In conclusion, TCP/IP is the backbone protocol set of the Internet and a major reason for the widespread adoption of the Internet. Understanding TCP/IP fundamentals is essential for anyone who wishes to understand how the internet works, or for those in IT or networking professionals.
 # Network Configuration

In the world of system and network administration, effectively configuring your network is akin to setting the foundation of a building. If not done right, other aspects of the network can face issues that could cause major disruptions. This section will help you understand the principles of network configuration and guide you through the process step by step.

A well-configured network improves the efficacy of data transmission, secures communication, and enhances the overall performance of your system. Network configuration involves organizing and managing a computer network for proper operation, support, and upgrade. It includes aspects such as setting network addresses, managing routing tables, and setting up firewalls, among others.

## The Basics of Network Configuration

First, it's essential to understand how Linux views your network. At the lowest level, we have the physical network hardware such as Network Interface Card (NICs), routers, LAN wires, switches. These pieces of hardware connect to each other physically (either wired or wirelessly) to form a network. On top of this physical network, Linux views the networking components as files. For instance, network interfaces are viewed as file-like structures, which you can interact with like you would a regular file.

### The /etc/network/interfaces File

The first thing you would manage during a network configuration in Linux is the `/etc/network/interfaces` file. This file defines how you can connect to the network. The `interfaces` file reads from top to bottom, with the first matching `allow-` line taking effect.

### The /etc/resolv.conf File

Another crucial file during network configuration is the `/etc/resolv.conf` file. This file contains information that allows a computer connected to a network to resolve names into addresses for certain applications.

### The ifconfig Command

Another essential part of network configuration is the `ifconfig` command. This command is used to configure the kernel-resident network interfaces. In short, it allows us to set up the IP and other network-related information for the network interfaces.

## Setting Up a Static IP Address on Linux

As a system administrator, it'd be a common task to set a static IP address on Linux based systems. Below are the steps to do that:

1. Open the `interfaces` file using your favorite text editor. We can use `nano` for this. Run `sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces`.

2. Look for lines that resemble `auto eth0 iface eth0 inet dhcp`. It tells the system to use DHCP to acquire an IP address for the interface `eth0`.

3. Modify these lines to configure a static IP. Here's an example:
   ```
   auto eth0
   iface eth0 inet static
   address 192.168.1.100
   netmask 255.255.255.0
   gateway 192.168.1.1
   ```

4. Save and exit `nano`.

5. To apply the changes, restart the network with `sudo systemctl restart networking`.

Congratulations! You have just configured a network interface on your Linux system.

## Network Troubleshooting

Another important part of Network Configuration is the ability to troubleshoot. When you face issues in connectivity, you should use `ping` to check the connection to your gateway, DNS server, and an external server.

Let's explore a few commands that are relevant to network troubleshooting:

- `ping`: Verify that you can reach another host or server over the network.
- `netstat`: Show network status information.
- `traceroute`: Print the route that a packet takes to reach the host.
- `nslookup`: Query Internet domain name servers.

## Conclusion

To sum it up, as a Linux system administrator, you need to effectively handle network configuration to ensure the smooth operation of your network. Remember the keystone of Linux is the filesystem-centric view, which means you can manipulate almost everything as files.

Note that every network is unique. Although the principles remain the same, the specifics may vary depending on the hardware, the size of the network, the network topology, and the requirements of the organization. Always take those into account while configuring your Linux network.

Comprehending and putting these configurations into practice are fundamental skills needed to manage Linux servers. Remember, the key to learning and mastering Linux networking is diligent practice. So, try these out on your Linux systems and keep exploring more. # Module 3: Networking and Troubleshooting

## Troubleshooting Network Issues

Troubleshooting network issues is an integral part of maintaining network stability and efficiency, whether you're a network administrator or a Linux enthusiast trying to keep your home network up and running. When facing a sudden network issue or anomaly, having a clear understanding of the network architecture and protocol operation is vital. This guide will walk you through the necessary procedures and methodologies to effectively address and resolve network issues in your Linux implementation.

### Understanding Network Issues

Before you can overcome a network issue, it's crucial that you understand what you're tackling. Network issues can be complex and are virtually always multifaceted. However, many network problems can be classified into common categories, including:

- Connectivity Trouble: This could mean anything from complete network failure to slower than usual operation, to intermittent network connections.
- Performance Deterioration: This category encompasses situations where the network is still operational but at a reduced speed, quality, or both.
- Security Breaches: This could include unauthorised attempts to access the network, or spread of malicious files.

### Common Linux Network Error Messages

Being familiar with common Linux error messages will help you diagnose an issue faster. Often, these errors can speak volumes about an underlying issue and provide crucial information needed for effective troubleshooting. Error messages like "Unable to resolve host", "Network is unreachable", "Connection timed out", and "No route to host", among others, are some of the most frequently encountered issues.

### Debugging Tools

A number of Linux tools can assist you in debugging network issues:

- `Ping`: The most straightforward network tool is `ping` command, which sends a series of packets to specified IP address or host. It checks the time it takes to get a response from the host, testing the system's connectivity and speed.

- `traceroute`: This tool helps find the path that your network packets take as they travel from your machine to their destination.

- `netstat`: The `netstat` command is a powerful tool that displays network connections, routing tables, interface statistics, and more.

- `ss`: `ss` command is a modern replacement for netstat, it can provide more detailed network statistics.

- `tcpdump`: This command allows recording and analysis of network packets. It can be used to inspect packets in detail and find out what exactly is occurring in your network.

- `nmap`: nmap is a security auditing tool, it can scan networks, hosts, ports and more.

### Basic Troubleshooting Methodology

Regardless of the complexity of a network issue at hand, a systematic approach to troubleshooting will almost always prove to be the most effective. You can begin by following these steps:

1. **Define the problem**: Begin by understanding the problem thoroughly. Gather data about the issue, closely observe the error messages, the frequency of the issue, and any recent changes that could have caused it.

2. **Identify the scope and the impact**: Not all network issues will disrupt all users or network functions. Identifying the scope of a problem can lead to quicker problem resolution.

3. **Form a hypothesis**: Based on the problem definition and scope, develop a theory on why the problem is happening.

4. **Test the hypothesis**: Use debugging tools to test your hypothesis. Modify network settings, if necessary, based on your theory.

5. **Solve the problem**: If the outcome of your test matches your hypothesis, you can take steps to fix the issue.

6. **Document the issue and solution**: Document the problem encountered and its resolution. It will help in identifying recurring issues or quick resolution in case the problem repeats.

### Hands-on Demo: Solving a Network Issue

Let's walk through a common scenario where you might experience a network issue and how you might go about fixing it. We'll be using the `ping` command.

```sh
ping www.google.com
```

If you're not getting responses, then we might have a network issue. We can double-check the issue by pinging another well-known IP address.

```sh
ping 8.8.8.8
```

If you're getting responses from `8.8.8.8` but not from `www.google.com`, it could indicate a DNS resolution problem.

To solve the problem, we might have to check our DNS configurations in `/etc/resolv.conf` and update it accordingly.

Please note: The scenario demonstrated above is simplified for demonstration purposes. Real-world network issues can often be more complex and may require deeper analysis and several rounds of testing.

In summary, troubleshooting network issues requires proficiency in using the right tools, having a systematic problem-solving technique, and a good understanding of the Linux network architecture. It is a critical skill for any System Administrator to ensure a secure and efficient network environment. Keep practicing the methodologies explained here along with Linux network commands to enhance your ability to troubleshoot network issues effectively. # Module 3: Networking and Troubleshooting

## Sub-topic: DNS and DHCP

In this section of the course, we will delve into the specifics of DNS (Domain Name System) and DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration protocol). Both of these concepts play a critical role in how data is handled and routed in networking infrastructure. Understanding these concepts is vital to troubleshooting network issues, as they provide the backbone for most network operations. 

### DNS: Domain Name System

#### Introduction

The Domain Name System (DNS) is a decentralised naming system used to provide human-readable names to numerical IP addresses on the internet or private network. For example, when you type a URL like "www.google.com" into your web browser, the DNS system translates that into the actual IP address of Google's server. 

#### Working of DNS

When a device makes a request to a domain, such as "www.example.com", that request is sent to a DNS server. The DNS server uses the domain to find the corresponding IP address stored in its records. The server then sends back the IP address to the device, which can then connect to the website. 

The DNS server that translates domain names into IP addresses is known as a name server. There are several types of DNS servers, including primary servers, secondary servers, and caching servers. Primary servers store and manage the domain's original records. Secondary servers are redundant servers that copy information from the primary server. Caching servers store DNS query results for a period to decrease DNS server load.

#### DNS Records

There are various types of data records stored in a DNS server's database, which provide information about domains:

1. *A Record:* Most common, used to point a domain or subdomain to an IP address.
2. *CNAME Record:* Stands for Canonical Name Record, used to alias one domain to another.
3. *MX Record:* Stands for Mail Exchange Record, used to direct emails to a particular mail server.
4. *TXT Record:* Used to store text-based information related to a domain.
5. *NS Record:* Stands for Name Server record, used to delegate a subdomain or domain to a set of name servers.

Understanding DNS records is crucial for troubleshooting network problems because incorrectly configured DNS records can cause a variety of issues, such as the inability to resolve a website's IP address or the delivery of email to incorrect servers.

### DHCP: Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol

#### Introduction

The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is a network protocol used to provide quick, automatic, and centralised management of IP addresses within a network. 

#### Working of DHCP

A DHCP server assigns an IP address to a device on the network when it connects (a process known as an IP lease). This leased IP address is used by the device to communicate on the network and is returned to the DHCP server's pool when the device disconnects.

The DHCP process involves several steps:

1. *DHCP Discover:* The client broadcasts a request for an IP address.
2. *DHCP Offer:* The DHCP server offers an IP address to the client.
3. *DHCP Request:* The client requests the offered IP address.
4. *DHCP Acknowledgement:* The server acknowledges the request and assigns the IP to the client.

This efficient automated process saves administrators from manually configuring IP addresses on every device on the network.

#### Benefits of DHCP

Understandably, DHCP plays a crucial role in managing network infrastructure, particularly in large organisations. DHCP offers numerous benefits, including:

1. *Automation:* Reduces the need for manual setup.
2. *Reduces Errors:* Minimises human error, improving network stability.
3. *Conserves IP Addresses:* Ensures minimal wasted IP usage through dynamic allocation.
4. *Supports Mobility:* Great for environments with many transient users, like coffee houses or student dorms.

### Conclusion

Understanding DNS and DHCP is vital to any network administrator as they represent the foundation upon which modern networking is built. This understanding goes a long way in diagnosing and troubleshooting network issues you may face in your career. # Module 3: Networking and Troubleshooting

## Subtopic: Firewall and Selinux

This section will explore the important concepts related to Firewall and Security-enhanced Linux (Selinux) and its usage in a Linux environment.

### Understanding Firewalls in Linux

A firewall is a network security device that monitors and filters incoming and outgoing network traffic. It functions as a barrier between a trusted network and an untrusted network and dictates what traffic is allowed to traverse from one side to the other.

In the context of Linux, the term "firewall" commonly refers to `iptables`, a user-space utility program that allows a system administrator to configure the IP packet filter rules of the Linux kernel firewall, implemented as different Netfilter modules.

#### Features of Iptables 

- It supports four kinds of tables, namely: 
   - `Filter`: used for packet filtering
   - `NAT`: used for Network Address Translation
   - `Mangle`: used for special packet alteration
   - `Raw`: used to exempt a packet from connection tracking

- Each table contains a list of chains. 

- Each chain is a list of rules which can match a set of packets.

- Each rule specifies what to do with a packet that matches.

- This structure allows for efficient performance and flexibility in configuring firewall rules.

### Basics of Iptables

The basic syntax of the `iptables` command is:

```bash
iptables [-t table] command [match] [target/jump]
```

To list all the existing rules in `iptables`, use the `-L` option as shown:

```bash
iptables -L
```

This will display all the existing rules in `iptables`.

To add a rule, use the `-A` option followed by the rule. For example, to block all incoming traffic from a specific IP address, the command would be:

```bash
iptables -A INPUT -s 192.168.0.1 -j DROP
```

The `-s` option specifies the source address, and `-j DROP` tells `iptables` to drop all packets from that address.

To delete a rule, replace `-A` with `-D`, like so:

```bash
iptables -D INPUT -s 192.168.0.1 -j DROP
```

### Security-Enhanced Linux (Selinux)

Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux) is a mandatory access control (MAC) security mechanism implemented in the kernel. It is designed to protect the server against misconfigurations and compromised daemons. It put limits and instructs server daemons or programs what files they can access and what actions they can take on these files.

SELinux has three basic modes of operation:

- `Enforcing`: SELinux policy is enforced. SELinux allows access based on SELinux policy rules. This is the default mode on RHEL based systems.

- `Permissive`: SELinux does not deny access, but denials are logged for actions that would have been denied if running in enforcing mode.

- `Disabled`: SELinux is turned off entirely.

To check the current status of SELinux, use the `getenforce` command:

```bash
getenforce
```

To change the SELinux mode without editing any files, you can use the `setenforce` command. For example:

```bash
setenforce Permissive
```

Note: The above command does not persist across reboots. To make it persistent, modify the `/etc/selinux/config` file and set the `SELINUX` parameter to the desired mode.

SELinux includes tools that can give you insights on why certain actions are being blocked. The `audit2why` can give you insights on why things are being blocked by SELinux.

In conclusion, understanding and configuring Firewalls and SELinux effectively can help keep your Linux systems secure and well monitored. It's essential for system administrators to familiarize themselves with these security mechanisms and how to employ them properly on their systems. Proper usage of firewalls and SELinux can save your organization from a significant number of security threats.
