## Subtopic 1: Understanding Resilience 

Resilience is the psychology of strength, perseverance, and personal growth in the face of adversity. The resilient individuals always strive to bounce back and recover from the hardships and stresses in their lives. They demonstrate an amazing ability to turn challenges into opportunities and learn from their experiences.

This module will help you delve into the complexities of the resilience, helping you understand it from a holistic perspective.

#### Concept of Resilience

Resilience, in its simplest form, is the ability to adapt and bounce back when things don't go as planned. It's about enduring hardship, and being able to rebound from adversity or risks. But resilience isn't about moving on unscathed, it's about transforming from the experience. 

Resilient people don't wallow or dwell in failures; they acknowledge the situation, learn from their mistakes, and then move forward. In fact, that’s precisely what makes them resilient.

According to the American Psychological Association (APA), resilience is not a trait people are born with; it involves behaviors, thoughts, and actions that anyone can learn and develop. 

#### Importance of Resilience

Resilience has pivotal importance in life. 

1. **Improved physical health:** Resilient individuals are sick less often. It is because they have better coping mechanisms when it comes to stress, which can translate into a myriad of physical health benefits.

2. **Better mental health:** Resilience directly affects mental health. Less susceptibility to depression, improved mental stamina and increased life-satisfaction are some of the noted benefits.

3. **Enhanced relationships:** Resilient individuals are capable of fostering strong, nurturing relationships. They handle social interactions and negotiation better, resulting in healthier relationships.

4. **Success at work:** A resilient person can bounce back from failure and try again. Such determination often leads to success. Their capacity to cope with high-stress situations enables them to perform better at their work.

Thus, resilience is a key psychology concept that everyone can benefit from, whether they are simply looking to improve their own mental wellbeing or are seeking to enhance their performance in a professional sphere. 

#### The 3Cs of Resilience

A major model of resilience in psychology was developed by Dr. Al Siebert who studied mental toughness for many years. His book, `The Resiliency Advantage`, explains that resilient individuals often have what he calls protective factors. 

Dr. Siebert’s model of resiliency consists of the three Cs: 

1. **Challenge** – Resilient people view a difficulty as a challenge, not as a paralyzing event. They look at their failures and mistakes as lessons to be learned from, and as opportunities for growth. They don't view them as a negative reflection on their abilities or self-worth.

2. **Commitment** – Resilient people are committed to their lives and their goals, and they have a compelling reason to get out of bed in the morning. Commitment isn't solely restricted to their work – they commit themselves to their relationships, their friendships, the causes they care about, and their religious or spiritual beliefs.

3. **Control** – Resilient people spend their time and energy focusing on situations and events that they have control over. Because of this, they can put their effort into creating action plans and then acting upon them.

## Subtopic 2: Historical Overview of Resilience Theory 

Resilience theory has emerged from a rich and varied history. This module will introduce you to the development and evolution of resilience theory, and the pioneering minds that greatly contributed to its understanding.

#### Early Conceptions of Resilience

Early conceptions of resilience emerged from studies of children and families who seemed to defy logic by adapting well despite high risks, such as poverty, parental mental illness, or adverse childhood experiences. This led to a dynamic field of study dedicated to understanding the processes of positive adaptation despite adversity.

Initial research was heavily influenced by psychologists working in the area of individual differences and their impact on adaptation. The the roots of resilience, thus, tie back to the broader interest in understanding human potential for change and adaptation.

#### Norman Garmezy's Work

Norman Garmezy, a developmental psychologist and clinician at the University of Minnesota, met thousands of children in his four decades of research. But it was the children of parents with mental illness that shaped his views of resilience. Garmezy's work in the 1970s established the basis for the study of resilience as a dynamic process, rather than a personal trait.

Garmezy's groundbreaking studies in the 1980s identified resilient children and dissected what made them resilient. His work is among the first to highlight the importance of high self-expectations and social competence in resilient children.

#### Emmy Werner's Kauai Longitudinal Study

Emmy Werner's Kauai Longitudinal Study, spanning over three decades, contributed greatly to the understanding of resilience. Werner and her colleagues studied a cohort of children born in 1955 on the island of Kauai, Hawaii.

Her team found that about one-third of children born into high-risk situations grew up to be resilient adults. Her studies emphasized how important relationships and positive role models were for building resilience. Werner's work contributed to a systemic view of resilience, highlighting the role of communities and systems in promoting resilience.

#### From Resilience as Trait to Resilience as Process

A paradigm shift in understanding resilience occurred in the late 1990s. Researchers began to see resilience as not a trait, but a complex interplay of both risk and protective factors, both intrinsic and extrinsic to the individual. 

Psychologists Ann Masten and Norman Garmezy, identified resilience as ordinary magic, arguing that normal adaptive processes can foster resilience, and that it is not something exceptional or mystical.

#### 21st Century Resilience Theory

In the twenty-first century, resilience theory has branched into multiple directions, including developmental psychopathology, positive psychology, and studies of adult and community resilience. 

Researchers such as Michael Rutter have pushed the field towards a more nuanced understanding of how genetic factors can interact with environmental ones to increase or decrease the likelihood of successful adaptation.

Now, resilience is understood as the capacity of a system to absorb disturbance and still retain its basic function and structure. It is about stepping up to the plate when life throws you a curveball. It is not about bouncing back, but about moving forward.

Understanding the historical evolution of resilience theory is critical for coaches. It reminds us that resilience is not a static concept. It is dynamic and evolving, just like human beings.

## Subtopic 3: Factors Influencing Resilience 

Resilience is a result of a combination of personal, societal, and environmental factors. It can be strengthened or weakened by various triggers and stressors. It's a dynamic process that changes over time, influenced by both inborn traits and acquired skills.

#### 1. Individual Factors

Individual factors that boost resilience include:

- **Positive outlook:** An innate or cultivated sense of optimism can greatly bolster resilience. This includes the ability to laugh at oneself and life's absurdities and the ability to perceive life's complexities as challenges versus burdens.

- **Emotional awareness:** Understanding and being comfortable with your own emotions can aid in resilience. By identifying what you're feeling, you can manage your reactions to stressful situations.

- **Problem-solving skills:** Having effective strategies to negotiate obstacles and solve problems can boost resilience, as these individuals are more likely to feel they can tackle anything that comes their way.

- **Self-efficacy:** Those who believe in their abilities to manage situations and achieve goals are more likely to bounce back from adversity.

- **Self-esteem:** A healthy sense of self-worth helps an individual to tackle and bounce back from adversity.

#### 2. Environmental Factors

- **Supportive Relationships:** Relationships that provide love and trust, provide role models, and offer encouragement and reassurance, enhance resilience.

- **Community resources:** Access to social institutions that provide health, education, welfare, and support for individuals and families, are instrumental in bolstering resilience.

- **Positive school experiences:** A positive learning environment where children feel safe, supported, and valued, significantly improves resilience.

#### 3. Social Factors 

- **Socioeconomic Status:** A high socioeconomic status can provide more access to resources that can aid and contribute to enhancing resilience. 

- **Cultural Beliefs:** Promoting beliefs and traditions that encourage family and community cohesion can boost resilience. Many cultures have customs that promote interconnectedness and support in times of adversity.

It's important to note that factors influencing resilience will vary over the course of an individual's life. What's pivotal to a child's resilience will differ from what's essential for an adult's resilience. Resilience in later life will be determined by factors distinct from those in earlier life stages.

Understanding these factors can help you better comprehend your client's contexts and work towards building these factors which will strengthen their resilience.


## Subtopic 4: Models of Resilience 

While resilience is widely recognized as a complex construct, there are several accepted models that help in understanding it. Below are two key models that are particularly useful.

#### 1. The Ecological-Transactional Model

The Ecological-Transactional Model of resilience was proposed by psychologists Ann S. Masten and John J. Curtis. This model portrays resilience as a dynamic, changing process that needs to be understood in the context of a person's entire ecological system.

According to this model:

- Resilience is a person-environment interaction. 
- It is not a fixed trait, but rather a process of coping in the face of adversity.
- Many factors, both internal and external, can influence this process. These include individual traits, family support, and broader social systems.

This model emphasizes the fact that resilience or vulnerability is an outcome of interaction between individuals and their environment.

#### 2. The Biopsychosocial Model

The Biopsychosocial Model argues that resilience is a product of three overlapping components: biological, psychological, and societal factors.

- **Biological Factors** include genetic influences, brain structure, and overall health. These can influence how a person responds physically to stress.

- **Psychological Factors** can interact with the biological ones to determine how stress is perceived and managed. This includes coping strategies, mental health, and cognitive abilities. 

- **Social Factors** are the social support systems that help individuals cope with stress. Family, friends, mentors, or a supportive community can contribute to resilience.

These models underscore that resilience is an interactive process. It unfolds over time, shaped by an individual's biological attributes, personal belief system, coping strategies, and social support network.

Coaching professionals can use these models to create strategies that augment resilience. Understanding these models can also help coaches identify the aspects of resilience that may need strengthening within a client, and provide a conceptual basis for the development and implementation of resilience strategies.

## Subtopic 5: Assessment of Resilience 

Accurate assessment of resilience provides useful insights into a person's ability to cope with stress. 

##### Resilience Scale (RS)

Created by Wagnild and Young in 1987, the Resilience Scale (RS) is one of the most widely used measures of resilience. The original RS contains 25 items and two components, personal competence and acceptance of self and life.

##### Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC)

The Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC) is a test for resilience and is designed for clinical practice. It is a brief self-rating questionnaire that measures the ability to cope with stress.

##### Resilience Scale for Adults (RSA)

The Resilience Scale for Adults (RSA) is a tool that captures protective factors and resources in adults facing psychosocial stress. The RSA is an inventory that demonstrates satisfactory psychometric properties, and which can be used to assess resources and protective factors evident in people during periods of significant stress.

Understanding the resilience of prospective coachees provides a useful starting point in the coaching relationship. It offers insights into their strengths and areas for development, helping you to create tailored coaching strategies.
