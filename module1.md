# Introduction to Red Hat Linux

Red Hat Linux is one of the many Linux distributions out there. It is renowned for its stability and support, making it a popular choice in the enterprise world. This course revolves around familiarizing you with the basics of this operating system.

To start with the basics, Linux is an open-source, Unix-like operating system first created by Linus Torvalds in 1991. Red Hat Linux, or simply Red Hat, is a distribution, or "distro," of this system. The behavior of the Linux kernel can be changed by varying parameters either at compile-time, or more commonly, at run time. 

Unlike some other Linux distributions, Red Hat is a commercial product, which means it comes with fee-based supports, such as Red Hat Network (RHN) and software enhancements.

## Overview

Based on open-source technologies, Red Hat was established in 1993 and has since become a major player in the world of open-source solutions. It offers a wide range of products and services including storage, operating system platforms, middleware, applications, management products, and support, training, and consulting services. 

Red Hat's flagship product is the Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), which is one of the most popular commercial Linux distributions. RHEL possesses a robust ecosystem of certified applications and hardware that are performance tuned and hardened for the most demanding datacenters.

RHEL is built with corporate and enterprise users in mind, and concentrates mainly on stability rather than constant updates. The basis for RHEL is the commitment to provide hardware and software compatibility with each new release and to maintain compatibility throughout the lifespan of each version.

## Installation

The installation process of Red Hat Linux is pretty straightforward, whether you're doing it from the CD/DVD or from the bootable USB stick. It involves:

- Ensuring system meets minimum requirements
- Partitioning the hard disk
- Selecting the time zone
- Setting the root password
- Creating the user account

While going for the installation, the key thing to remember is developing a clear plan beforehand about the volume, directory structure and partitioning scheme for your available memory.

## File System and Structure

The file hierarchy system might be new to those who come from a non-Unix background. Below is an overview of the LINUX filesystem hierarchy standards (FHS) which Red Hat follows:

Typical Red Hat filesystem hierarchy includes:

- **/**: Root directory which includes all other filesystems and directories.
- **/bin**: Essential command binaries which are required for all users.
- **/sbin**: System binaries, used for system maintenance and administrative tasks.
- **/home**: Home directories for all users.
- **/root**: Home directory for the root user.
- **/etc**: Configuration files for the system.

Besides these, there are other important directories including /var, /lib and /usr.

## Red Hat Package Manager (RPM)

The Red Hat Package Manager or RPM is one of the major strengths of Red Hat Linux. It's best known for its great flexibility in handling software. It is a powerful command line driven package management system capable of installing, uninstalling, verifying, querying, and updating computer software packages. 

Each software package consists of an archive of files along with information about the package like its version, a description, etc. It also includes the powerful yum utility, which can manage and resolve dependencies for RPM packages.

## Basic Commands

As a part of the introduction, some of the most commonly used Linux commands are:

- **pwd**: Shows the path of the current directory
- **ls**: Lists the contents of the directory
- **cd**: Change the directory
- **mkdir**: Create a new directory
- **rm**: Remove a file or directory
- **cp**: Copy files or directories
- **mv**: Move or rename files or directories

All of these commands are used extensively while you operate your Red Hat Linux system, so it's good to have them at your fingertips.

Red Hat Linux is a solid, free operating system for server deployment. With great documentation and community support, it has earned a place in the hearts of millions of users around the world. This introduction is just the first step in your journey with Red Hat Linux and it gets more interesting from here. # Basic Shell Commands in Linux 

The shell in Linux is a direct line to the operating system. It’s a text-based interface where the user can interact directly with the operating system using specific commands. In this course, we will be focusing on the basics of shell commands that will allow you to perform operations such as listing directories, changing directories, creating, viewing and editing files, etc. These are the building blocks that will allow you to utilise Linux in a practical and efficient way, once these fundamentals are mastered you can then go on to more complex commands and tasks.

## What is a Shell?

Before we jump into the basic commands, it's essential to understand what a shell is. A shell, in computing, is a user interface for access to an operating system's services. It is named a shell because it is the outermost layer around the operating system. Most simply, a shell can be considered a platform that a user uses to interact with the system.

Among the two types of shells - Graphical User Interface (GUI) and Command Line Interface (CLI), our focus will be on CLI. Here, commands are typed on a terminal or console to perform certain operating system tasks.

## Getting Started with Basic Commands

### Command 1: pwd (Print Working Directory)
This command displays the current directory you are in. If ever lost or disoriented within the folders of the Linux filesystem, 'pwd' is the first go-to command.

```python
pwd
```

### Command 2: ls (List)
'ls' is another basic and frequently used command that allows you to see the contents of the current directory. Without any options, ‘ls’ will display the files and folders in the current directory.

```python
ls
```

### Command 3: cd (Change Directory)
'cd' is used to traverse the Linux file system hierarchy. You can move around in the terminal, jumping from one directory to the next using 'cd', followed by the directory’s name.

```python
cd directory_name
```

### Command 4: touch
The 'touch' command is a straightforward way to create new, empty files. It’s also used to change the timestamps on existing files and directories.

```python
touch file_name
```
    
### Command 5: rm (Remove)
The ‘rm’ command is used to remove files and directories. However, use this command with caution; Linux does not have a trash bin from where you can retrieve deleted items.

```python
rm file_name
```

### Command 6: man (Manual)
The 'man' command followed by another command will open the Linux manual page for that command. This guide serves as the greatest reference for all Linux Commands.

```python
man command_name
```
    
### Command 7: clear
When your terminal gets cluttered with results of commands and you want a fresh terminal view without closing and opening the terminal window, we use the 'clear' command.

```python
clear
```

### Command 8: exit
When you’re done with your work, or you need to close the current terminal, use the 'exit' command.

```python
exit
```

## Conclusion

These are the most fundamental shell commands for any Linux user. Understanding and knowing these commands is crucial for day-to-day tasks on a Linux system. From creating folders and files to navigating through the system, or even deleting data, these commands form the foundation of your journey in using Linux efficiently.

Practice makes perfect. The best way to learn these commands is by using them in a Linux terminal. After you're comfortable with these commands, you'll find that they are your friends, helping you to quickly accomplish tasks in Linux. 

The more you use and practice Linux commands, the better understanding you will have for the Linux shell environment. There is a vast world beyond these basic commands waiting to be discovered.

Remember, for every command you seek to use, first try to explore the manual using the 'man' command and understand the functionality it provides. This way, you won't become just a command user but a command decoder who understands what exactly happens when a certain command is executed.

Cheers to your Linux journey! Keep exploring!

Next, we will be diving deeper into the nuances of "File Systems and Permissions" in Linux. Stay tuned! # Module 1: Linux Fundamentals

## Subtopic: File Systems and Permissions

Linux provides a structured hierarchy to organize files and directories. This hierarchical structure is termed as the File System. In this guide, we will explore the basics of the Linux filesystem, different types of filesystems, and how to manage file permissions in Linux.

#### Linux File System Basics

The Linux File System starts with the root directory, denoted as "/", under which all other files and directories reside. The major directories under '/' include:

- /bin – Contains necessary system binaries (executable files).
- /etc – Contains system configuration files.
- /home – User home directories reside here.
- /opt – Optional software and packages reside here.

#### Types of Linux File Systems

Several file systems are supported by Linux. Here are some notable ones:

1. **ext4**: An evolutionary progression of the original ext filesystem, ext4 includes many powerful features like larger file system/file sizes, journaling, and backward compatibility with ext2 and ext3.

2. **XFS**: A robust and scalable journaling filesystem with excellent performance.

3. **Btrfs**: B-tree file system (Btrfs) is a file system based on the copy-on-write (COW) principle.

4. **NTFS**: The standard filesystem of Windows systems, it's also readable (and usually writable) by Linux systems via the NTFS-3G driver.

#### Managing File Permissions 

In Linux, each file and directory has three levels of ownership - User, Group, and Others - and three types of permissions - Read (r), Write (w), and Execute (x). Using these permissions, we can define who can access and manipulate files.

Below are the commands used to alter file permissions:

1. `chmod`: Change access permissions of files and directories.

2. `chown`: Change file owner and group.

3. `chgrp`: Change group ownership.

For example, if you want to modify the permissions on a file, you'd use the chmod command, give the numeric code of the permissions (read = 4, write = 2, execute = 1), and then the file name. So, `chmod 755 filename` would set it to read, write, and execute for the user; read and execute for the group; and read and execute for others.

Understanding the file system and permissions is essential to work efficiently with the Linux environment. Be careful while assigning permissions to avoid any unwanted file manipulations. Knowledge of these aspects will be useful when you further explore Linux and its features. 

I hope this section on Linux File Systems and Permissions was helpful. In upcoming sections, we will learn about networking in Linux, process management, and other critical Linux fundamentals. # Module 1: Linux Fundamentals

## Subtopic: Networking in Linux

Networking in Linux is a central part of any system administration. Understanding how to setup a network, create, configure and maintain network services are fundamental to managing a Linux based network. In this guide, we will introduce key networking concepts, discuss various networking commands, and explain some basic network troubleshooting techniques.

### Understanding Networking Concepts

Before diving into networking commands, it’s worth understanding some basic concepts:

- **IP Address**: An IP (Internet Protocol) address is a numerical label assigned to each device participating in a computer network. It provides the location of a networked server or client.
- **DNS**: DNS (Domain Name System) translates human-friendly website names into computer-friendly IP addresses. It is an integral part of how the internet functions as it allows users to connect to websites using easy-to-remember domain names rather than having to remember IP addresses.
- **TCP/IP**: TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/ Internet Protocol) is a suite of communication protocols used to interconnect network devices on the internet.
- **Ports**: A port is an endpoint of communication in an operating system where network connections start and end. Ports are numbered for consistency and programming.
- **Firewalls**: Firewalls are systems designed to prevent unauthorized access to or from a private network. Firewalls can be implemented as both hardware and software, or a combination of both.

### Linux Networking Commands

Now let's discuss some basic but incredibly useful networking commands that will come handy during Linux network management.

- **Ping**: The `ping` command is one of the most commonly used commands for troubleshooting network connectivity issues. It sends a request to a specific IP address and waits for a reply.
```
ping www.google.com
```
- **Netstat**: The `netstat` command shows networking status. It displays network connections, routing tables, interface statistics, etc.
```
netstat
```
- **ifconfig**: The `ifconfig` command is used to display or configure a network interface.
```
ifconfig
```
- **traceroute**: The `traceroute` command is used to show the path that packets take to get from your machine to a destination.
```
traceroute www.google.com
```
- **ssh**: The `ssh` command is used to log into a remote machine and work on it directly.
```
ssh user@hostname
```
- **telnet**: The `telnet` command is used to interact with another host using the TELNET protocol.
```
telnet hostname port
```
### Network Configuration

The configuration of the network in Linux is through system files such as `/etc/network/interfaces` or `/etc/sysconfig/network` (depending on the distribution). You can edit these files directly to set up your network.

### Troubleshooting Network Issues

Troubleshooting network issues in Linux could often be challenging given the opaque nature of network activities. Here are some common tools to diagnose and resolve networking-related issues:

- Diagnose Network Connection with `ping` and `traceroute`.
- Check Network Status with `netstat`.
- Monitor Network Traffic with `tcpdump`. This command provides a way to capture network traffic and analyze it.

### Conclusion

Networking is a broad field and in this guide, we've only scratched the surface. These basics, however, should be more than enough to help you handle the basic networking chores on a Linux machine. The commands discussed above form the basics of Linux networking, and mastering these will help a lot while managing a Linux network. From here, you can start exploring more advanced networking topics such as firewall configurations,` iptables`, and advanced routing techniques. 
Remember that every Linux distribution can have its own network management, so always check the documentation of the system you're working on. # Module 1: Linux Fundamentals

## Subtopic: Process Management

One of the core duties of any system administrator is managing processes. Every application that runs on a Linux machine initiates a series of processes. In Linux terminology, a running instance of a program is referred to as a process. As an integral part of the Linux operating system, mastering process management is essential for managing a Linux system effectively.

### What is a Process?

In Linux, a process is an instance of an executed program. When you run an application or command in Linux, the system creates a process for it. Each process in Linux is assigned a unique Process Identification Number (PID) which is used to control it. Processes can initiate other processes, known as child processes. Each process also has a parent process. The first process that runs on a Linux system, known as init, has a PID of 1.

### Types of Processes in Linux

In Linux, there are two types of processes:

1. **Foreground Processes (Interactive)**: These processes run in the system foreground and interact directly with the user. For instance, when you run a command in a terminal, it is a foreground process.

2. **Background Processes (Non-interactive)**: These processes run in the background without interacting with the user. These are especially useful for running applications that do not need user intervention to perform tasks.

### How to View Running Processes

The `ps` command is the standard tool to fetch the snapshot of the current processes. By default, it shows only the processes started in the current terminal.  To view all the processes running on the system, use the `ps -e` or `ps -ef` command. 

The `ps -ef` command provides a comprehensive view of the process details, including the PID, the time the process was started, the command used to start the process, etc.

For continuos monitoring of the processes you can use `top` command. The `top` command provides a dynamic real-time view of the running system. It can display system summary information as well as a list of tasks being managed by the Linux kernel.

### How to Start a Process

Starting a process in Linux is quite straightforward – simply type the command in the terminal. For instance, to start the nano text editor, you only have to type `nano` in the terminal.

### How to Kill a Process

There are times when a process may become unresponsive or you might need to stop it for another reason. In these cases, you would need to kill the process. The command for this is `kill PID` where PID represents the Process ID. You can find the PID by using the `ps` command.

### Priority and Niceness Value

In Linux, several processes may need CPU time simultaneously. Since CPU can handle only one job at a time in a core, operating system introduces concept of priority. Each process is assigned a priority. Process with higher priority will get the CPU time over a process with lower priority.

There may be times when you'd want to adjust the niceness value of a process to meet the requirements of your system. The `renice` command can be used to change the niceness value of a system process.

### Managing Processes with 'top' and 'htop'

While `ps` and `kill` commands are powerful, they aren't the only tools for managing processes. `top` is a command that displays dynamic real-time information about your running system, and `htop` is a more colorful, graphically driven display that might be easier for some users.

There's quite a bit more to delve into with Linux process management – everything from backgrounding and foregrounding processes to managing process trees. However, getting comfortable with viewing, starting, and stopping processes are the fundamentals that will make the more advanced topics much easier to tackle.

Remember, practice is key when it comes to mastering process management in Linux. It's encouraged to get hands-on practice alongside theoretical learning for better absorption of these concepts.
